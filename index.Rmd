I am a Ph.D. candidate in the [Department of Statistics](https://www.stat.iastate.edu/) at Iowa State University and Graduate Research Assistant at the [Center for Statistics and Applications in Forensic Evidence](https://www.forensicstats.org/) (CSAFE).
My research interests are in pattern recognition and forensic statistics, with an emphasis on firearm and toolmark evidence.

I earned my M.Sc. in statistics in 2020 from Iowa State University and B.Sc. in Honors Mathematics and Mathematics: Secondary Education from Winona State University in 2017.

I love creating tools to help others learn and analyze data more effectively.
Check out the [cartridgeInvestigatR](https://csafe.shinyapps.io/cartridgeInvestigatR/) web application I developed to help forensic examiners engage with cartridge case comparison algorithms.
