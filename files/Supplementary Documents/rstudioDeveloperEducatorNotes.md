## Key phrases

RStudio creates software that **helps people understand data and make better decisions in real-world applications**

The Open Source group aims to provide a **seamless end-to-end data science experience, and to help data scientists learn the software engineering skills they need**

helping users **learn and flourish**

engaging in package development activities, particularly on packages like roxygen2, testthat, devtools, and usethis that form a fundamental part of our package development workflow

contribute particularly to **documentation** and **error messages**

**articulate user needs** and work with the primary maintainer to implement bigger features

connect with the developer community, understand pain points, and produce open, accessible and polished materials to onboard new package developers and to help part-time developers maintain their packages over time

use content creation tools, such as **markdown, video and github** to produce **pedagogically appropriate and accessible resources** to guide package developers and **highlight relevant use cases** for different segments of the community

Champion a diverse and welcoming community of learners and **integrate accessibility into our resources**

**Advocate for the needs** of our package developer community who are newer to our tools and bring their feedback back to the open source teams

## Topic ideas

Has developed at least one R package.
- cmcR CRAN package
- impressions, scored
- regular use of devtools, usethis, roxygen2, and testthat

Experienced user of git and GitHub.
- discuss use of git/Github for professional and personal projects 

Has developed documentation, tutorials or other learning materials **used by other educators**
- Documentation of R packages using roxygen2
- Statistics for Forensic Practitioners, Sampling for Forensic Practitioners, STAT 528
  - Regular use of markdown and video to demonstrate concepts
    - Recording professional videos for CSAFE sampling course
  - Tutorials: rstudio visual editor
  - Learning materials :course development for Statistics for Forensic Practitioners, Sampling for Forensic Practitioners, 
     - **Tutoring**: while developing curriculum, I was able to pull from my experience working with a diverse group of students to identify areas where further growth was needed and enact changes that improved the experience for future students
       - **Used by all of the other math tutors at the center**
     - Created formative assessments for CSAFE courses to "check your understanding"
  - CSAFE course and STAT 528 materials **will be used by future educators**

Knowledgeable in digital and educational accessibility good practices 
- *Look more into this*

Experience teaching coding or data science workshops or courses
- CSAFE courses, STAT 528
- Recording professional videos for CSAFE sampling course

Experience working with online communities, global or multi-lingual communities a plus
- *think more on this*
- STAT 528 being completely online

Strong written and verbal communication skills
- *should be self-evident*

As a statistician developing methods for forensic evidence, it is vitally important that I create tools that are pedagogically appropriate and easily accessible to others.

Dear Hiring Manager at RStudio,

Thank you for the opportunity to apply for the Developer Educator position at RStudio.
As someone who is passionate about both data science and education, I relish the opportunity to connect the R community with RStudio's package development tools.
I am excited to apply my teaching abilities and development skills to create accessible, pedagogically-sound resources and advocate for developer's needs.

As a teaching assistant at Iowa State University, I frequently develop educational resources used by other educators.
I created multimedia educational resources for a Visual Business Analytics online course that I teach focused on introducing Master's of Business Analytics students to data visualization in R.
This includes a series of self-produced videos about cleaning and summarizing data with tools like dplyr, ggplot2, and shiny.
I also created accompanying RMarkdown files for students to follow along with the videos and perform their own analyses.
This aligns with my preferred teaching philosophy: John Dewey's experiential learning that emphasizes "learning by doing."
I received positive feedback from students on these videos, who felt more comfortable with performing data analyses despite having little prior R programming experience.
These educational materials will be used in future iterations of the course by other instructors.

I have developed multiple R packages to document and share my research in my research assistant role at the Center for Statistics and Applications in Forensic Evidence.
My Ph.D. research focuses on developing objective and statistically-sound techniques to compare cartridge case impression evidence.
I have published one package on CRAN called "cmcR" and plan to publish at least two more, "impressions" and "scored," that are currently available on GitHub.
It is important to me that these methods are accessible, both in terms of acquisition and comprehensibility, to fellow researchers and forensic practitioners.
As such, I created the packages to align to the four principles of a tidy API according to Hadley Wickham's "tidy tools manifesto."
This includes writing code and documentation to be human-friendly and modularizing the analysis pipeline to work easily with the pipe operator.
I regularly use tools like devtools, usethis, testthat, and roxygen2 to ease package creation and documentation.
I recognize how important these packages are to supporting a robust and productive developer community.

I look forward to discussing how my training and experience will be an asset to RStudio and the R developer community.
I am a firm advocate of RStudio's mission to help people understand data using accessible, open-source tools.
I am eager for the opportunity to support this mission as an educator and advocate for the R community.

Sincerely,
Joseph Zemmels
